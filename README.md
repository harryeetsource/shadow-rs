`shadow-rs` is a Windows kernel rootkit written in Rust, demonstrating advanced techniques for kernel manipulation while leveraging Rustâ€™s safety and performance features. This project is intended for educational and research purposes.

The project also provides useful crates for developing rootkits, such as [**shadowx**](/shadowx/), which consolidates core logic and essential techniques. It includes rootkit-specific tricks, with plans for additional features in future updates.

The documentation on how to execute CLI commands can be found on the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/joaoviictorti/shadow-rs/wiki)

## Features
 
### Process Features

- âœ… Hide and unhide processes.
- âœ… Modify process signature levels to handle `Protected Processes (PP)` and `Protected Process Light (PPL)`.
- âœ… Protect processes against termination and memory dumping.
- âœ… Elevate process privileges to SYSTEM, granting full administrative access.
- âœ… Terminate target processes.
- âœ… List all protected and hidden processes.

### Thread Features

- âœ… Hide and unhide threads.
- âœ… Protect threads from termination or suspension.
- âœ… List all protected and hidden threads

### Driver Features

- âœ… Hide and unhide kernel-mode drivers.
- âœ… Enumerate all loaded drivers.
- âœ… Enable or disable Driver Signature Enforcement (`DSE`) to allow loading of unsigned drivers.
- âœ… Blocking Driver Loading.

### Callback Features

- âœ… List registered callbacks for process creation, thread creation, image loading, and registry operations.
- âœ… Remove or restore specific callbacks.
- âœ… List all removed callbacks.

### Misc Features

- âœ… Capture keystrokes from user input in real-time with kernel-level interception.
- âœ… Disable Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence (`EtwTi`).
- âœ… Cleaning Driver Artifacts from Memory Dumps in Case of BSOD.
- âœ… Compile Encryption String.
- âœ… Support for Reflective Driver Loading.

### User Mode Code Execution

- âœ… Inject shellcode or DLLs into processes using `ZwCreateThreadEx`.
- âœ… Asynchronous Procedure Call (`APC`) injection to execute shellcode or DLLs in alertable threads.
- âœ… Execute shellcode in processes using `Thread Hijacking`.

### Module Features

- âœ… Hide modules from process memory listings.
- âœ… Enumerate all loaded modules.

### Registry Features

- âœ… Hide and unhide registry keys and values to prevent detection and manipulation.
- âœ… Apply registry protection to prevent key or value deletion or overwriting.

### Network Features

- âœ… Hide and unhide network ports from netstat and similar monitoring tools.

## Installation

* Install Rust from [**here**](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
* Follow [Microsoft's guide](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-drivers-rs?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) to set up Rust for kernel development. 

## Supported Platforms

- âœ… Windows 10 / 11 (x64 only)

## Build Instructions

#### Driver

Navigate to the [driver](/driver) directory and build the kernel driver:

```cmd
cargo make default --release
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Note: The first build must be executed as Administrator. Subsequent builds do not require elevated privileges.

To enable mapping support for tools like kdmapper, compile with:
```cmd
cargo make default --release --features mapper
```

#### Client

Navigate to the [client](/client) directory and build the user-mode client:
```cmd
cargo build --release
```

For compatibility with mapped drivers:
```cmd
cargo build --release --features mapper
```

## Setup Instructions

#### Enable Test Mode or Test Signing Mode 

```
bcdedit /set testsigning on
```

#### Create / Start Service

You can use [Service Control Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/service-control-manager) or [OSR Driver Loader](https://www.osronline.com/article.cfm%5Earticle=157.htm) to load your driver.

## Debugging 

Use Windbg to attach to the kernel and monitor driver activity.

```
bcdedit /debug on
bcdedit /dbgsettings net hostip:<IP> port:<PORT>
```
